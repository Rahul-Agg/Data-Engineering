# MySQL to S3 Data Migration using Docker, Debezium, Kafka, and PySpark 

This repository provides a seamless solution for migrating data from a MySQL database to Amazon S3 using modern data processing technologies. By leveraging Docker containers, Debezium connectors, Apache Kafka, and PySpark, this system ensures a smooth and efficient data flow, enabling real-time synchronization and analysis.

## How It Works

1. **Debezium Captures Changes**: Debezium, a CDC (Change Data Capture) platform, monitors the MySQL database in real-time. It captures any changes made to the database, such as inserts, updates, and deletes. 

2. **Data Flows to Kafka**: Debezium feeds these changes into Apache Kafka topics, where they are organized and made available for consumption. Kafka acts as the messaging backbone, ensuring fault tolerance and scalability. 

3. **PySpark Processes Data**: A PySpark job is responsible for processing the data received from Kafka topics. PySpark provides a powerful and scalable processing framework that can handle large datasets efficiently. Here, you can implement transformations, aggregations, or any data manipulations as needed. 

4. **Data Lands in S3**: After processing, the PySpark job transfers the data to Amazon S3, a robust and scalable cloud storage service. S3 ensures durability, availability, and security for your data, making it an ideal choice for storing valuable business information.

 ## Key Components 

- **Docker Containers**: Docker simplifies the setup by encapsulating each component within isolated containers, ensuring consistency across different environments. 

- **Debezium Connectors**: Debezium connectors capture changes at the database level, enabling real-time data streaming without the need for complex ETL processes. 

- **Apache Kafka**: Kafka acts as the message broker, efficiently handling data streaming between Debezium and PySpark components.

- **PySpark**: PySpark, the Python library for Apache Spark, provides a high-level API for distributed data processing. Its flexibility and scalability make it suitable for handling various data processing tasks.

 

- **Amazon S3**: Amazon S3 offers a reliable and cost-effective storage solution for your processed data. Its integration capabilities and global availability make it a preferred choice for data storage and archival. 

## Getting Started 

1. **Clone the Repository**: Begin by cloning this repository to your local machine. 

   ```bash

   git clone <repository-url>

   cd <repository-folder>

   ``` 

2. **Configuration Setup**: Customize the Docker configurations, Debezium settings, and PySpark job according to your MySQL and S3 requirements. Update the necessary files inside the `config/` directory. 

3. **Start the System**: Utilize Docker Compose to launch the containers. 

   ```bash

   docker-compose up -d

   ``` 

4. **Data Processing**: Implement your data processing logic within the PySpark script. This script reads data from Kafka topics, processes it, and stores the results in S3. 

5. **Execute the PySpark Job**: Run the PySpark job inside the PySpark container.

   ```bash

   docker exec -it <pyspark-container-id> /bin/bash

   spark-submit --master local[2] --packages org.apache.spark:spark-sql-kafka-0-10_2.12:3.2.0 app.py

   ``` 

## Customization and Scalability 

- **Schema Evolution**: Handle schema changes in your MySQL database with ease. Debezium captures schema modifications and ensures that your data pipeline remains flexible. 

- **Scaling Resources**: Adjust the allocated resources for Kafka, Debezium, and PySpark containers based on your workload and data volume. Docker Compose allows easy scaling of container resources. 

- **Error Handling**: Implement error handling mechanisms within your PySpark job to manage exceptions, retries, and logging. This ensures the reliability of your data processing pipeline. 

## Conclusion 

This comprehensive solution offers a robust, real-time data migration process from MySQL to Amazon S3. By leveraging Docker for containerization, Debezium for change data capture, Apache Kafka for reliable data streaming, and PySpark for scalable data processing, you can create a tailored data pipeline that meets your specific business needs. 

Feel free to extend, modify, and enhance this solution to accommodate additional data sources, processing logic, or destination systems. Happy data processing!
